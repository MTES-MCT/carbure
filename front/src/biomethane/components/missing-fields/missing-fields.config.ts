/**
 * Configuration file for biomethane fields validation system.
 *
 * This file defines the mapping between form sections and their fields
 * for the biomethane annual declaration process. It serves as the central configuration
 * for identifying which sections contain missing mandatory fields and need user attention.
 *
 * The configuration is organized by pages (Digestate and Energy) and their respective
 * sections, with each section containing an array of fields.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Maps form sections to their fields
 * - Supports dynamic section highlighting and field focusing
 * - Used by the missing fields validation system to guide users to incomplete sections
 *
 * Usage:
 * - The getMissingFieldsSectionIds function uses this config to determine which sections
 *   have missing fields based on the server response
 * - Sections with missing fields are automatically registered and highlighted
 * - Users are guided to incomplete sections with visual indicators and auto-focus
